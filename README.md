# Machine_Learning_From_Scratch
The aim of these projects will be to understand any interesting machine learning algorithms and techniques and demonstrate them by coding them first-hand. As I am juggling a full-time work load as well as a part time Masters degree in data science, the completion of these projects may be some time apart. If you are looking at any of these and kind enough to give any feedback, please reach out to me!

I aim to explore the following algorithms:

1) K-means (Completed July 2018)
2) KNN (Completed July 2018)
3) Linear Regression (Completed September 2018)
4) Logistic Regression
5) Non Negative Matrix Factorisation
6) Deep Learning
