# Machine_Learning_From_Scratch
The aim of these projects will be to understand any machine learning algorithms I am interested in and demonstrate them by coding them first-hand. As I am juggling a full-time work load as well as a part time Masters degree in data science, the completion of these projects may be some time apart.

I aim to explore the following algorithms:

1) K-means (Completed July 2018)
2) KNN (Completed July 2018)
3) Logistic Regression
4) Linear Regression
5) Deep Learning
6) Non Negative Matrix Factorisation
